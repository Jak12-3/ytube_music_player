# Installation via HACS

Please install this custom component via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/prerequisites).

Once you've installed HACS follow this [Guide](https://codingcyclist.medium.com/how-to-install-any-custom-component-from-github-in-less-than-5-minutes-ad84e6dc56ff) and install the yTube_music_player from the default HACS repository.

# Setup

You need to grab and convert a cookie from youTube Music. This is described in https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#copy-authentication-headers and also below. It is highly recommended to use Google chrome for this step!

![setup](setup.png)

**1. Basic steps for grabbing**

1. Open the development tools (I've used google chrome) [Crtl+Shift+I / F12]
2. Open the Network tab
3. Open https://music.youtube.com, log out, log in, browse a bit around like clicking on the library in the top menu
4. Search for "browse" (for me only one item shows up)
5. Go to "headers" -> "request headers" 
6. copy everything starting after the "accept: */*" (mark with a mouse and copy to clipboard)

**2. Please use the config flow of Home Assistant**

7. Open Configuration -> Integrations -> "add integration" -> "YouTube Music Player"
   1. If the integration didn't show up in the list please REFRESH the page
9. Paste the cookie into the indicated field, all other fields are optional or provide default values 
   1. It is highly recommended to enter the entity_id of your default output player, otherwise you have to set that after every reboot
   2. The second page shows several entity_ids for dropdown field. You can leave the default values, even if you don't want to use those field and don't add them to your configuration... or clear the field ... both will work fine (see [below](https://github.com/KoljaWindeler/ytube_music_player#dropdowns-buttons-and-marksdowns))

**Although YAML configuration is still possible: Please remove it and configure the player via config_flow or several functions will be missing**

## Shortcuts
The screenshot below shows the mini-media-player from kalkih (https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player)

![mini-media-player](shortcuts.png)

This mediaplayer offers shortcuts, which can be used to select the remote_player, album to play or playlist with a single click:

```
- type: 'custom:mini-media-player'
  entity: media_player.ytube_music_player
  artwork: cover
  hide:
    shuffle: false
    icon_state: false
  shortcuts:
    columns: 3
    buttons:
      - name: Badezimmer
        type: source
        id: badezimmer
      - name: Keller
        type: source
        id: keller
      - name: Laptop
        type: source
        id: bm_8e5f874f_8dfcb60f
      - name: My Likes
        type: channel
        id: PLZvjm51R8SGuxxxxxxx-A17Kp3jZfg6pg
      - name: Lala
        type: playlist
        id: PLZvjm51R8SGuxxxxxxx-A17Kp3jZfg6pg
```

## Services
The following commands are available:
mini-media-player shortcut type | service call | details
-- | -- | --
`source` | **media_player.select_source** *source=id and entity_id=[this]* | selects the media_player that plays the music. id can be an entity_id like `media_player.speaker123` or just the name `speaker123`
`playlist` | media_player.play_media | plays a playlist from YouTube. *You can get the playlist Id from the Youtube Music website. Open a playlist from the library and copy the id from the link e.g. https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6H6TfFpYvpersxxxxxxxxxaPueTqieF*
`channel` | media_player.play_media | Starts a radio based on a playlist. So the id has to be a **playlist_id**
`vid_channel` | media_player.play_media | Starts a radio based on a videoId. So the id has to be a **video_id**
`album` | media_player.play_media | plays an album. *You can  get the album Id from the Youtube Music website. Open an album from the library https://music.youtube.com/library/albums and copy the Id from the links*
`track` | media_player.play_media | will play only one dedicated track
`history` | media_player.play_media | will play a playlist from your recent listen music **on the website or the app** *the music that you play with this component will not show up in the list*
`user_tracks` | media_player.play_media | this type will play the **uploaded** tracks of a user
`user_album` | media_player.play_media | **uploaded** album of a user
`user_artist` | media_player.play_media | play all **uploaded** tracks of an artists

All calls to *media_player.play_media* need three arguments: media_content_id is the equivalent of the shortcut id, media_content_type represents the type (e.g. album) and the entity_id is always media_player.ytube_music_player

You can also select the music you want to listen to via the media_browser and look up the media_content_type and media_content_id in the attributs of the player.

In addition the following special commands are also available:
Service | parameter | details
-- | -- | --
`ytube_music_player.rate_track` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player, `rating`: thumb_up / thumb_down / thumb_middle / thumb_toggle_up_middle, rate_track, `song_id`: ID of the track | Rates the currently playing song (or if provided: the song_id). The current rating is available as 'likeStatus' attribute of the player entity_id. middle means that the rating will be 'indifferent' so basically removes your previous rating
`ytube_music_player.limit_count` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player, `limit`: number of tracks | Limits the amount of tracks that is loaded into the playlist, e.g. to stop playing after 3 tracks. Setting -1 as value disables the feature again.
`ytube_music_player.call_method` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player, `command`: reload_dropdowns | Reloads the dropdown list of all media_players and also the playlists. Might be nice to reload those lists without reboot HA
`ytube_music_player.call_method` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player, `command`: interrupt_start | Special animal 1/2: This will stop the current track, but note the position in the track. It will also store the track number in the playlist and the playlist. Finally it will UNTRACK the media_player. As result you can e.g. play another sound on that player, like a door bell or a warning
`ytube_music_player.start_radio` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player | Starts a radio, based on the current playing track
`ytube_music_player.call_method` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player, `command`: interrupt_resume | Special animal 2/2: This is the 2nd part and will resume the playback
`ytube_music_player.add_to_playlist` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player,  `song_id`: define the ID of the song you want to add. Skip this parameter if you want to add the song that is currently playing,  `playlist_id`: define the ID of the playlist, skip this if you've started a channel based on your own playlist and want to add the song to that playlist | Adds a song to a playlist
`ytube_music_player.remove_from_playlist` | `entity_id`: media_player.ytube_media_player,  `song_id`: define the ID of the song you want to remove. Skip this parameter if you want to remove the song that is currently playing,  `playlist_id`: define the ID of the playlist, skip this if you want to remove the song from the current playlist (requires that you've started playing via playlist) | Removes a song from a playlist



## Dropdowns, Buttons and Marksdowns
The player can controlled with shortcut from the mini-media-player, with direct calls to the offered services or simply by turing the player on.
However certain extra informations are required to controll what will be played and where to support the "one-click-turn-on" mode. These are presented in the form of drop-down fields, as shown in the screenshot below. The dropdowns can be copied from the yaml at [package/default.yaml](https://github.com/KoljaWindeler/ytube_music_player/blob/main/package/default.yaml). *You can also rename those dropdowns if you have to (e.g. if you run two players). Go to the 'options' dialog (configflow) and change the default values during the second step to update the ytube_media_player if you do that.*

The player attributes contain addition informations, like the playlist and if available the lyrics of the track
![lyrics](lyrics.png)
The yaml setup is available at [package/markdown.yaml](https://github.com/KoljaWindeler/ytube_music_player/blob/main/package/markdown.yaml)

## Sonos support / Proxy

Playback on Sonos speakers has several issues. Just forwarding the stream to the media_player returns a "mime-type unknown" error. 
I've done some testing on a Sonos Speaker of a friend and found that it is possible to download the current track and serve it from the webserver that homeassistant offers.
This feature can be activated by providing two settings:
1) `proxy_path` | This is the local folder, that the component is using to STORE the file. 
The easiest way it to provide your www folder. Be aware: If you're using a docker image (or HassOS) that the component looks from INSIDE the image.
So for most users the path will be `/config/www`
2) `proxy_url` | The path will be send to your Sonos speaker. So typically this should be something like `http://192.168.1.xxx:8123/local`. Please note that https will only work if you have a valid ssl-certificat, otherwise the Sonos will not connect. 

You can also use a dedicated server, if you don't want to use homeassistant as http server, or you have some special SSL setup.
If you're running docker anyway you could try `docker run --restart=always --name nginx-ytube-proxy -p 8080:80 -v /config/www:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx`
This will spin up server on port 8080 that serves `/config/www` so your `proxy_url` would have to be `http://192.168.1.xxx:8080`.

You can use this also with other speakers, but it will in general add some lack as the component has to download the track before it will start the playback. So if you don't need it: don't use it. If you have further question or if this is working for you please provide some feedback at https://github.com/KoljaWindeler/ytube_music_player/issues/38 as I can't test this on my own easily. Thanks!


## Auto Advance
When playing a playlist / album / radio the natural expectation is to play the next track once the last has finished. Ytube_music_player can't offload this task to the remote_player (the one that actually plays the music) as most players don't support playlists.

Thus Ytube_music_player has to track the status the remote_player and detect the 'end of track' to start the next track from the list.

Most player I've tested (Chromecast / Google Home / Browser Mod) will transistion from `playing` to `idle`.
As a result the code of Ytube_music_player will play the next track whenever this state transition happens.
Sadly not all player follow this logic. E.g. MPD based media_player will transition from `playing` to `off` at the end of a tack, some sonos speaker will switch to `paused`. I've added special commands to Ytube_music_player to overcome those issues. This will change the way ytube_music_player will react on state changes. E.g. if the `off_is_idle` command was sent, ytube_music_player will advance to the next track whenever the remote_player will transition from `playing` to `off`. This will enable auto-next-track. 

*The drawback is obviously that you can't switch off the playback on the remote_player anymore (meaning the `off` button of `media_player.mpd`) because ytube_music_player has to understand this as end of track. You can of cause still shutdown to playback by turning of ytube_music_player.*

### MPD fix

The mpd media_player will transition to `off` instead of `idle` at the end of each track as mentioned above. Ytube_music_player is able to handle this.
Please add this automation from **@lightzhuk** to your configuration:
```yaml
- alias: mpd_fix
  initial_state: true
  trigger:
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
  action:
    - delay: 00:00:12
    - service: ytube_music_player.call_method
      entity_id: media_player.ytube_music_player
      data:
        command: off_is_idle
```

### Sonos fix

The sonos media_player will transition to `pause` instead of `idle` at the end of each track as mentioned above. Ytube_music_player is able to handle this.
Please add this automation to your configuration:
```yaml
- alias: sonos_fix
  initial_state: true
  trigger:
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
  action:
    - delay: 00:00:12
    - service: ytube_music_player.call_method
      entity_id: media_player.ytube_music_player
      data:
        command: paused_is_idle
```

## Debug Information
I've added extensive debugging information to the component. So if you hit an error, please see if you can get as many details as possible for the issue by enabling the debug-log-level for the component. This will produce quite a lot extra information in the log (configuration -> logs). 

There are two ways to enable the debug output (as of 20210303):

### 1. Reroute debug output to error via service
- Open Developer tools
- open service tab
- call service below

```yaml
service: ytube_music_player.call_method
entity_id: media_player.ytube_music_player_cf <-- replace this with your player 
command: debug_as_error
```

This will instantly post all messages as errors until you reboot homeassistant:
![Debug as error](debug_as_error.png)

### 2. Let Homeassistant show debug information
- edit the `configuration.yaml` and add the logger section
- Please keep in mind that a restart of Homeassistant is needed to apply this change. 

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ytube_music_player: debug
```

## Multiple accounts
Not yet tested, but should work in general. Please create two entities via the Config_flow and use **different** paths for the header file

## FAQ
- **[Q] Where are the input_select fields?**  
  [A] you have to add them to your configuration, simply copy the content of https://github.com/KoljaWindeler/ytube_music_player/blob/main/package/default.yaml to your configuration.yaml (and restart home-assistant) 
  
- **[Q] Where can I find the ID for e.g. a playlist?**  
  [A] simply start the playlist / album / track via the media_browser. Once the music is playing open the `developer tools` -> `states` and search for your `media_player.ytube_music_player`. Note the `_media_type` and the `_media_id` and use them for your service calls / shortcuts
  
- **[Q] I get 'malformed used input' what should I do?**  
  [A] I can't really explain what happens here, but simply remove the integration (on the integration page, no need to remove it via HACS) and set it up once more.
  
 - **[Q] What is legacy radio?**  
  [A] YouTube Music offers differnt ways to play a radio. The 'legacy' version would choose a random track from that playlist and create a radio based on that single track. The 'non legacy' version will be based on the complete playlist. At least for me the 'legacy' way offers more variaty, the 'non legacy' is mostly the same list. 
  
 - **[Q] What is Shuffle vs Random vs Shuffle Random**  
  [A] Once shuffle is enabled you can choose the method:  
  1.) **Shuffle** will shuffle the playlist on generation and the play straight 1,2,3,..., this is the default  
  2.) **Random** will NOT shuffle the playlist on generation but pick the tracks randomly, repeats can happen  
  3.) **Shuffle Random** will shuffle the playlist on generation and pick the next random, repeats can happen  
  You can change the mode when you add the input_select.ytube_music_player_playmode
  
  - **[Q] Can I search for items**  
  [A] yes, please have a look at this little clip https://youtu.be/6pQJa0tvVMQ  
  basically call the service `ytube_music_player.search` and open the media_browser after that. There should be a new item that contains the results
